## About Me

I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in the [Robotics Department](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am conducting my studies under the supervision of [Prof. Omer Inan](https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/omer-t-inan) at [Inan Research Lab](https://irl.gatech.edu/). Broadly, I am interested in decision-making problems involving data-driven methodologies such as machine and deep learning. My current research focuses on developing predictive models to address challenges in wearable health and physiological sensing. This includes leveraging advanced methodologies such as deep learning-based time series representation learning (e.g., supervised, unsupervised and self-supervised learning, contrastive learning, multi-modal data fusion), signal processing, traditional machine learning, anomaly detection, state-space modeling, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. My research is/was supported by fundings from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Prior to my graduate studies, I was an undergraduate student in the [Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering](https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/) at Bilkent University. I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yildiray Yildiz in [Systems Laboratory](https://yildirayyildiz.com/about/) for developing behavioral human driver models using game theory, control theory and reinforcement learning.
