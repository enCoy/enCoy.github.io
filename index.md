Personal page in progress... 

I am a graduate student in the [Robotics Department](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 

I am studying applied machine learning on wearable sensor data, and I am conducting my studies in [Inan Research Lab](https://irl.gatech.edu/)
