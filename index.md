I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the [Robotics Department](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am conducting my studies under the supervision of [Prof. Omer Inan](https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/omer-t-inan) at [Inan Research Lab](https://irl.gatech.edu/). Broadly, I am interested in applied machine and deep learning. Specifically, my research includes development of predictive time series models for solving challenges in wearable health and physiological sensing. 

Prior to my graduate studies, I was an undergraduate student in the [Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering](https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/) at Bilkent University. I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yildiray Yildiz in [Systems Laboratory](https://yildirayyildiz.com/about/) for developing behavioral human driver models using game theory, control theory and reinforcement learning.
