Here I share non-technical (philosophy, literature, art, cinema etc.) suggestions. I am only sharing the ones that I love the most and I tried to sort them by the order of perceived value (totally subjective). 
## Non-Fiction Books
* _American Prometheus_ by Kai Bird, Martin J. Sherwin - Biography (Nolan's Oppenheimer is also strongly suggested)
* _Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business_ by Neil Postman - Media
* _Ways of Seeing_ by John Berger - Art
* _Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies_ by Jared Diamond - History
* _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ by Stephen Coey - Self Development
* _Rest_ by Alex Pang - Self-Development
* _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear - Self-Development
* 
## Fiction Books
* _Les Mis√©rables_ by Victor Hugo - Classic
* _The Stranger_ by Albert Camus - Classic
* _Harry Potter_ by J.K. Rowling - Fantasy (books are better than motion pictures)
* _Ward No. 6_ by Anton Chekhov - Classic (suggested for Stoics especially)
* _Slaughterhouse-Five_ by Kurt Vonnegut
* _The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia_ by Ursula K. Le Guin - Utopia (or Distopia)
