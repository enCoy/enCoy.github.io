Resources below are for me as well as visitors of this page. These include data science, machine/deep learning related sources that I have visited before and that I found very instructive.  

## Books 
[Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) (Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville)  <br> 
A beginner-intermediate level source for understanding what deep learning is, and for having an intuitive grasp of the material.  

[Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Introduction-Adaptive-Computation/dp/0262039249/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) (Andrew Barto, Richard S. Sutton) <br>
As it is clear from its name, this is a fantastic introduction to reinforcement learning. 

[Introduction to Linear Algebra](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Linear-Algebra-Gilbert-Strang/dp/0980232775) (Gilbert Strang) <br>
It is imperative to know fundamentals of Linear Algebra to do machine learning research, and this is a fantastic source. 

[https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-Production-Ready/dp/1098107969] (Chip Huyen) <br>
This is a book for the people working on deployment part. However, it is still a good source for researchers to appreciate the difficulty of maintaining these models for real customers.

## Online Lectures
[Deep Generative Models](https://kuleshov-group.github.io/dgm-website/) (Volodymyr Kuleshov) <br>
The best resource out there for understanding generative models (as of now). The instructor makes a fabulous job in connecting different developments in generative modeling which makes it very easy to understand and follow. 

[Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video_galleries/video-lectures/) (Gilbert Strang) <br>
Another perfect source from Prof. Strang. These video lectures are old but the contents are still fresh for machine learning researchers. 

[Reinforcement Learning Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ) (David Silver) <br>
This was the source that I learned reinforcement learning from. Content might be a bit outdated but wonderful for getting the fundamentals. 

[Stanford Machine Learning Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU) (Andrew Ng) <br>
This course is perfect for conventional machine learning basics. 

[Stanford CS231n - 2017 Video Lecture Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk) <br>
Great source for understanding the basics of deep learning.
