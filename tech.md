Resources below are for me as well as visitors of this page. 

## Books 
[Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) (Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville)  <br> 
A beginner-intermediate level source for understanding what deep learning is, and for having an intuitive grasp of the material.  

[Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Introduction-Adaptive-Computation/dp/0262039249/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) (Andrew Barto, Richard S. Sutton) <br>
As it is clear from its name, this is a fantastic introduction to reinforcement learning.
